# Length statement before creating character column by if statement #
length columnname $length

e.g.
data cars;
  set sashelp.cars;
  length CarType $6;                   # if without length statement, the length of created column would be as the first if statement. 
                                          In this case, column length will be 5, then "luxury" would be "luxur" #
  if Acolumn<1000 then CarType="Basic";
  else CarType="Luxury" ;
run;
